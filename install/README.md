# Installation instructions

### Step 1) If you are using ti89 Titanium, go directly to step 2!
 
If you are using Hardware 2 Ti89, it is mandatory to **install superstart** (otherwise you will get the famous "ASAP or Exec string too long" due to the large size of the program)
 
->  just send **"sstart.89K"** to the calculator
<br/>
### Step 2) The Blues Brothers game is composed of two files: you have to copy both files to the calculator
 
"Blues.89z" (the main program)
 
"level01.89y" (contains all sprites of the game)
<br/>
### Step 3) Just type "blues()" and the game starts
<br/>

# Controls

**ESC** quit the game
 
**Shift** (black key with an arrow) grab/launch objects
 
**Shift + up** enter doors
 
**"+"** slows down the game
 
**"-"** speeds up the game

# Note
 
the program has been tested on Hardware 2 Ti89 with v2.05 official TI OS** [ti89_2.05(2000-08).89u]
